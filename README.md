### (Video) Mashups for **FL Crew**'s Performances in **Nike College Street Dance League**

- **If I Ain't Got You**, 2023: [Bilibili] https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1mw411t7Mw

  Communicating with the choreographer, I used FL Studio's stem extraction function to seperate vocals and different instruments. Then I leveraged these stems to produce compact versions of two songs and wrote a drum fill and created SFXs for transitions linking two tracks (1'25'' and 2'49'' in the video, specifically).

### Writing Samples

I have two submitted papers in Machine Learning domain that can serve as writing samples:

- [Six-CD: Benchmarking Concept Removals for Benign Text-to-image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14855)
  This is a benchmarking project for evaluating State-of-Art text-to-image diffusion concept removal methods. We first crafted a comprehensive datasets spliting test prompts into six categories. Then I proposed a novel metric "In-prompt Retainability" to evaluate methods' ability to express irrelevant concepts when removals are triggered and we craft anothor corresponding dataset. I am the co-first author of this paper.

- [Self-Comparison for Dataset-Level Membership Inference in Large (Vision-)Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13088)
  In this project we proposed a novel dataset-level membership inference attack method. Inspired by datapoint-level neighborhood attack, I came up with the rudiment of "Self Comparison" and chose p-value as the threshold; my collaborator further extended the idea by "Half Comparison", leveraging conditional distribution to boost effectiveness. Our method demostrates more feasibility in practical compared to exsisting dataset-level MIA methods and surpasses them in performance.

### Source Codes

I have encountered both hardware-level & software-level programming in my course projects:
